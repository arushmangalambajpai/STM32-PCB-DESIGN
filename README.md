# STM32 PCB Project

## Overview
This repository contains the design files and documentation for a custom PCB based on the STM32 microcontroller, created using KiCAD.

## Features
- **Microcontroller:** STM32 series (e.g., STM32F4xxx, STM32L0xxx)
- **Peripherals:** Includes GPIO, ADC, DAC, PWM, timers, and communication interfaces such as USB, UART, SPI, and I2C.
- **Connectivity:** Supports various communication protocols for IoT applications.
- **Power:** Operates within a specific voltage range (e.g., 3.3V or 5V) with low power consumption capabilities.
- **Programming:** Easily programmable via SWD interface or USB bootloader.
- **Dimensions:** Compact size suitable for embedded applications.
